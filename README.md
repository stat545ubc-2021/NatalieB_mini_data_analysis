# **Mini Data Analysis** 

Welcome to my mini data analysis!
This Mini Data Analysis project is part of the UBC STAT545A course. In three installations, the objective of this project is to explore data analysis, visualization, the concept of tidy data, and choosing research questions that are relevant to the selected dataset. The dataset chosen is a subsample of a larger set of my own research looking into the role of acclimation temperature on thermal tolerance. It contains critical thermal maximum trial data for Chinook fry; a unique fish id, the acclimation treatment temperature, dropout time and temperature, as well as mass (g) and fork length (mm).

## General repository üåä

### *README.md:*

This file! contains descriptions of the content found in this repository.


### *.gitignore:*

This specifies untracked files to be deliberately ignored by Git.


### *mini data analysis.Rproj:*

contains the project options and can be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the file system.

### *CTmax_swim_Fry.csv:*

A comma-separated file format containing the dataset used for the analysis project.

## Deliverable 1, file Milestone.1 :fish:

### *mini data analysis deliverable 1.Rmd:*

Here you will find an exploration of different datasets and my research questions regarding the one chosen in an R markdown file. This file was written based off of "mini-project-1.Rmd" found in the STAT545 organization.
All code can be run in R with the appropriate packages installed(Packages needed included in code).


### *mini-data-analysis-deliverable-1.md:*

The file rendered from knitting "mini data analysis deliverable 1.Rmd".


### *mini-data-analysis-deliverable-1_files:*

This file contains the .png renderings of the graphs made in part 2. 

## Deliverable 2, file Milestone.2 üê†

### *mini data analysis deliverable 2.Rmd:*

Here you will find an exploration of my chosen dataset and my research questions through basic data summaries, tidy‚Äôing, graphing, and other manipulations in an R markdown file. This file was written based off of "mini-project-2.Rmd" found in the STAT545 organization.
All code can be run in R with the appropriate packages installed(Packages needed included in code).

### *mini-data-analysis-deliverable-2.md:*

The file rendered from knitting "mini data analysis deliverable 2.Rmd".

### *mini-data-analysis-deliverable-2_files:*

This file contains the .png renderings of the graphs made for question 1.2.

## Deliverable 3, file Milestone.3 ü¶à

### *mini data analysis deliverable 3.Rmd:*

### *mini-data-analysis-deliverable-3.md:*

The file rendered from knitting "mini data analysis deliverable 3.Rmd".

### *mini-data-analysis-deliverable-3_files:*

This file contains the .png renderings of the graphs made for tasks 1 and 2.


## File Output üê°

### body_mass_median.csv

This file is a .csv file format of the tibble containing data from deliverable 2; this information is the median body mass per acclimation temperature.
